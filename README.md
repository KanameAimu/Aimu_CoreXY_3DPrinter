# Aimu_CoreXY_3DPrinter

This is a RAMPS based [CoreXY](http://www.corexy.com/theory.html) 3D printer.  
A `CoreXY` Printer has these advantages:  
> Fast. We believe in speed. CoreXY's (mostly) parallel kinematics mean that the motors, typically the largest source of inertia on a DIY-grade stage, are stationary. This permits rapid accelerations.  
> Simple. CoreXY can be implemented with only three structural plates, all of which can nest during fabrication.  
> Flexible. Whether your medium is fabric or aluminum, the principle behind CoreXY permits motion stages to be rendered in a variety of materials and a wide range of sizes.
